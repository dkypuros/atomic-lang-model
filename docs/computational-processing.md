# Computational Processing Models for Recursive Language

## How Machines and Minds Handle Recursion

While formal grammars define recursive structures mathematically (see our [Mathematical Foundations](mathematical-foundations.md) for the complete framework), the actual processing of these structures requires computational models that can handle self-embedding with limited resources.

This document explores how the algebraic operations of [Merge and Move](mathematical-foundations.md#2-abstract-algebra-the-grammars-operations) are implemented computationally.

## The Processing Challenge

### Human vs. Machine Recursion

**Theoretical Capacity**: Infinite recursive depth
**Practical Reality**: Bounded by memory and processing constraints

Human sentence processing shows:
- Easy handling of right-branching: "I know [that you think [that she believes [...]]]"
- Rapid degradation with center-embedding: "The man [who the girl [who I know] likes] left"

## Classical Parsing Algorithms

### Recursive Descent Parsing

**Algorithm**:
```python
def parse_S():
    if match('a'):
        parse_S()
        expect('b')
    # else epsilon production
```

**Characteristics**:
- Direct implementation of recursive grammar rules
- Stack depth equals embedding depth
- Fails on left-recursive grammars without modification

### Chart Parsing (Earley Algorithm)

**Data Structure**:
```
Chart[i,j] = {A → α • β | A derives substring from i to j}
```

**Algorithm Steps**:
1. **Predictor**: Add incomplete productions
2. **Scanner**: Match terminals
3. **Completer**: Combine completed constituents

**Complexity**: O(n³) for context-free, O(n⁶) for mildly context-sensitive

### Bottom-Up Parsing (CKY)

**Dynamic Programming Approach**:
```
for length = 1 to n:
    for start = 0 to n-length:
        for split = start+1 to start+length-1:
            combine(chart[start][split], chart[split][start+length])
```

**Advantage**: Handles ambiguity systematically
**Limitation**: Requires Chomsky Normal Form

## Psycholinguistic Processing Models

### Left-Corner Parsing

**Motivation**: Humans process incrementally, left-to-right

**Algorithm**:
1. See leftmost terminal
2. Predict possible left corners
3. Build structure bottom-up and top-down simultaneously

**Stack Operations**:
- Push predicted categories
- Pop when constituents complete
- Stack depth correlates with processing difficulty

### Resource-Rational Processing

**Key Insight**: Humans trade accuracy for efficiency under memory constraints

**Mathematical Model**:
```
P(parse | sentence) ∝ P(sentence | parse) × P(parse) × memory_cost(parse)^(-α)
```

Where α controls the memory/accuracy trade-off.

**Predictions**:
- Exponential difficulty increase with embedding depth
- Garden-path effects when memory-efficient parse fails
- Individual differences in memory capacity

## Neural Network Approaches

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

**Basic Architecture**:
```
h_t = tanh(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t + b)
y_t = softmax(W_y h_t + b_y)
```

**Limitations with Recursion**:
- Vanishing gradients prevent long-distance dependencies
- Hidden state compression loses structural information
- Sequential processing doesn't match hierarchical structure

### Improved Architectures

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**:
```
f_t = σ(W_f [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)  # forget gate
i_t = σ(W_i [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)  # input gate  
C̃_t = tanh(W_C [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)  # candidate values
C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * C̃_t  # cell state
```

**Stack-Augmented Networks**:
- External stack memory for recursive structures
- Differentiable stack operations
- Better handling of center-embedding

### Transformer Architecture

**Self-Attention Mechanism**:
```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
```

**Advantages for Recursion**:
- Parallel processing of all positions
- Direct modeling of long-distance dependencies
- Multiple attention heads capture different relationships

**Limitations**:
- Quadratic memory complexity O(n²)
- No explicit hierarchical bias
- Position encoding doesn't capture tree structure

## Recursive Neural Network Grammars (RNNGs)

### Architecture

Combines:
- **Composition**: Build representations for constituents
- **Generation**: Predict next word/action
- **Attention**: Focus on relevant subtrees

**Operations**:
```
SHIFT(word): Add word to buffer
REDUCE: Combine top elements into constituent  
NT(X): Open new constituent of type X
```

### Mathematical Formulation

**State Representation**:
```
s_t = [stack_t, buffer_t, actions_t]
```

**Transition Function**:
```
s_{t+1} = f(s_t, action_t)
```

**Probability Model**:
```
P(sentence, tree) = ∏_t P(action_t | s_t)
```

## Bounded Memory Models

### Stack-Based Parsing with Limits

**Memory-Bounded CKY**:
- Beam search with fixed beam width
- Prune low-probability constituents
- Graceful degradation under memory pressure

**Predictions**:
- Processing difficulty increases with stack depth
- Errors occur at memory boundaries
- Performance depends on beam width

### Predictive Processing

**Surprisal Theory**:
```
Surprisal(word) = -log P(word | context)
```

**Integration Cost**:
- Cost increases with distance between dependent elements
- Mediated by working memory capacity
- Explains garden-path effects

## Implementation Considerations

### Parallel vs. Sequential Processing

**Human Brain**:
- Massively parallel neural computation
- Sequential constraint from temporal input
- Predictive processing reduces computational load

**Computer Systems**:
- Sequential CPUs benefit from explicit recursion
- Parallel GPUs prefer batch operations
- Trade-offs between memory and computation

### Memory Hierarchies

**Cache-Friendly Parsing**:
- Locality of reference in tree traversals
- Minimize pointer chasing
- Batch similar operations

**Distributed Processing**:
- Partition large parse forests
- Pipeline different parsing stages
- Balance load across processors

## Real-Time Constraints

### Incremental Processing

**Requirements**:
- Process input as it arrives
- Maintain partial analyses
- Revise analyses when necessary

**Challenges**:
- Ambiguity resolution under uncertainty
- Garden-path recovery
- Memory management for partial structures

### Time Complexity Analysis

| Algorithm | Time | Space | Recursion Handling |
|-----------|------|-------|-------------------|
| Recursive Descent | O(k^n) | O(d) | Direct, limited by stack |
| Earley | O(n³) | O(n²) | Chart-based, complete |
| CKY | O(n³) | O(n²) | Bottom-up, systematic |
| Left-Corner | O(n³) | O(d) | Incremental, psychologically plausible |

Where:
- n = sentence length
- k = branching factor
- d = maximum embedding depth

## Future Directions

### Neuromorphic Computing
- Spiking neural networks
- Event-driven processing
- Biological time constants

### Quantum Parsing
- Superposition of parse states
- Quantum parallelism for ambiguity
- Entanglement for long-distance dependencies

The challenge remains: bridging the gap between mathematical elegance of recursive grammars and the practical constraints of real-time, resource-limited processing systems.
